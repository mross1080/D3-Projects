This is a repository that holds various D3 Visualizations I've been practicing over the past year.  Files range from simple that just transform a JSON object/file into a graphical representation of the data, to my personal favorite, MusicSearch.js.  Music Search was what I built at my universities last hackathon, it was when I was just learning the ins and outs of ajax requests, and was a way of combining two separate skills I was learning at the same time.
